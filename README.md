# 📊 Statistical Computation Programs (JavaScript)

This project contains a collection of **five JavaScript programs** demonstrating key concepts in statistics — including measures of central tendency, dispersion, probability, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing.  

Each program is written in **vanilla JavaScript** and can be executed directly using **Node.js**.

## 🧮 Overview

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `q1_mean_median_mode.js` | Calculates **Mean**, **Median**, **Mode**, and **Weighted Mean** of a dataset |
| `q2_range_variance_stddev.js` | Computes **Range**, **Variance**, and **Standard Deviation**, showing all intermediate steps |
| `q3_dice_simulation.js` | Simulates rolling two dice **10,000 times** and estimates the probability of getting a sum of 7 |
| `q4_correlation_regression.js` | Calculates **Correlation Coefficient** and fits a **Linear Regression Line** using least squares method |
| `q5_hypothesis_test.js` | Performs a **Two-Sample t-Test** to check if the average marks of two classes are significantly different |
