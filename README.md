# üìä Statistical Computation Programs (JavaScript)

This project contains a collection of **five JavaScript programs** demonstrating key concepts in statistics ‚Äî including measures of central tendency, dispersion, probability, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing.  

Each program is written in **vanilla JavaScript** and can be executed directly using **Node.js**.
